# osu-practice-helper
Text file based osu! map practice helper, brought to you by the one who needs it the most.
Not quite finished yet.

The status messages can be configured with these keys in the configuration file `osuPracticeConf.txt`. These values are the current defaults:
```
idleStatusMessage=Idle
fcStatusMessage=check reddit
practicingStatusMessage=Practicing
attemptingStatusMessage=Doing runs
studyingStatusMessage=Studying
otherStatusMessage=Playing something else
```

TODOS:
* Set the configuration path to something alright
* Fetch the FC status (poll the osu api when it changes from doing runs to idle i guess)
